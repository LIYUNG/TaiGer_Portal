# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Note that the API endpoint should be modified to production server before build.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
